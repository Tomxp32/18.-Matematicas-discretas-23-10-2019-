		<h1>Goals of a Discrete Mathematics Course</h1>

		<h3></h3>
		<p>A discrete mathematics course has more than one purpose. Students should learn a particular
		set of <strong>mathematical facts</strong> and how to apply them; more importantly, such a course should teach
		students how to think logically and mathematically. To achieve these goals, this text <abbr title="enfatiza">stresses</abbr>
		mathematical reasoning and the different ways problems are solved. Five important themes
		are <abbr title="entretejidos">interwoven</abbr> in this text: mathematical reasoning, combinatorial analysis, discrete structures,
		algorithmic thinking, and applications and modeling. A successful discrete mathematics course
		should carefully <abbr title="mezclar">blend</abbr> and balance all five themes. <br><br>

		<strong>1. Mathematical Reasoning:</strong> Students must understand mathematical reasoning in order to
		read, comprehend, and construct mathematical arguments. This text starts with a discussion
		of mathematical logic, which serves as the foundation for the subsequent discussions of
		methods of proof. Both the science and the art of constructing proofs are <abbr title="dirigido, abordado">addressed</abbr>. The
		technique of mathematical induction is stressed through many different types of examples
		of such proofs and a careful explanation of why mathematical induction is a valid proof
		technique.
		<br><br>
		<strong>2. Combinatorial Analysis:</strong> An important problem-solving skill is the ability to count or enumerate objects. The discussion of enumeration in this book begins with the basic techniques
		of counting. The stress is on performing combinatorial analysis to solve counting problems 
		and analyze algorithms, not on applying formulae.<br><br>
		<strong>3. Discrete Structures:</strong> A course in discrete mathematics should teach students how to work
		with discrete structures, which are the abstract mathematical structures used to represent
		discrete objects and relationships between these objects. These discrete structures include
		sets, permutations, relations, graphs, trees, and finite-state machines. <br><br>
		<strong>4. Algorithmic Thinking:</strong> Certain classes of problems are solved by the specification of an
		algorithm. After an algorithm has been described, a computer program can be constructed
		implementing it. The mathematical portions of this activity, which include the specification
		of the algorithm, the verification that it works properly, and the analysis of the computer
		memory and time required to perform it, are all covered in this text. Algorithms are described
		using both English and an easily understood form of pseudocode. <br><br>
		<strong>5. Applications and Modeling:</strong> Discrete mathematics has applications to almost every conceivable area of study. There are many applications to computer science and data networking
		in this text, as well as applications to such diverse areas as chemistry, biology, linguistics,
		geography, business, and the Internet. These applications are natural and important uses of
		discrete mathematics and are not contrived. Modeling with discrete mathematics is an extremely important problem-solving skill, which students have the opportunity to develop by
		constructing their own models in some of the exercises.

		<h3>What is discrete mathematics?</h3> <p>Discrete mathematics is the part of mathematics devoted to
		the study of discrete objects. (Here discrete means consisting of distinct or unconnected
		elements.) The kinds of problems solved using discrete mathematics include:
		 <br><br>How many ways are there to choose a valid password on a computer system?
		 <br><br>What is the probability of winning a lottery?
		 <br><br>Is there a link between two computers in a network?
		 <br><br>How can I identify spam e-mail messages?
		 <br><br>How can I encrypt a message so that no unintended recipient can read it?
		 <br><br>What is the shortest path between two cities using a transportation system?
		 <br><br>How can a list of integers be <abbr title="ordenar">sorted</abbr> so that the integers are in increasing order?
		 <br><br>How many steps are required to do such a sorting?
		 <br><br>How can it be proved that a sorting algorithm correctly sorts a list?
		 <br><br>How can a circuit that adds two integers be designed?
		 <br><br>How many valid Internet addresses are there?
		 <br><br>
		You will learn the discrete structures and techniques needed to solve problems such as these.
		More generally, discrete mathematics is used <abbr title="cuando, siempre que">whenever</abbr> objects are counted, when relationships between finite (or countable) <abbr title="conjuntos">sets</abbr> are studied, and when processes involving a finite number
		of steps are analyzed. A key reason for the growth in the importance of discrete mathematics is
		that information is stored and manipulated by computing machines in a discrete <abbr title="moda">fashion</abbr>.
